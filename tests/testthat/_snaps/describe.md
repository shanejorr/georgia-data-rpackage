      -- Notes -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      * Missing values: NA means suppressed (small counts), not zero; zeros are real
        from 2010 on.
      * Limitations: 2004-2010 figures predate Georgia's adoption of the federal
        four-year adjusted-cohort methodology (ACGR, first reported 2011) and use the
        state's earlier leaver-based rate; the 2010->2011 state rate drop (~81% to
        ~67%) is a methodology break, not a real decline — do not trend across it.
        Suppressed cells are NULL (not zero) from 2010 onward, but 2004-2009 sources
        use literal ZEROS for suppressed cells — a zero rate/count in those years may
        be real or suppressed and cannot be distinguished; treat very small cohorts
        in 2004-2009 with caution. num_cohort is NULL for every row in 2012-2016 (the
        source publishes no denominator in those years). The 2004 file lists every
        public school, including elementary and middle schools with no graduating
        cohort, so 1,703 of its 2,037 all-students school rows have no graduate count
        or rate; from 2005 only schools with a graduating cohort are listed (344 in
        2005). School rows do not always sum to the published district row: of the
        42,815 district rows (all subgroups) with a published num_graduates and at
        least one published school value, 468 publish a district num_graduates below
        the sum of its school rows, 49 of them among the 4,039 all-students rows
        (source-published, 2005-2025; e.g. 2016 Whitfield 709 vs 810, 2014 Richmond
        economically_disadvantaged 582 vs 1,286) — use the official district/state
        rows for rollups rather than summing school rows. economically_disadvantaged
        is not a like-for-like group across years. Statewide it is 55-56% of the
        cohort in 2017-2021, then 47% (2022), 53% (2023), 61% (2024) and 66% (2025),
        and district coding shifts: Cobb County puts 98% of its 2021 cohort in the
        group (36-38% in 2017-2020 and 2023, 20% in 2022) and under 2% of its
        graduates in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and districts with 100+ graduates that
        report 10% or less of them in the group or suppress it number 6-11 a year in
        2021-2023 (0-2 a year in 2016-2020). GOEWS does not document these shifts.
        The group's graduation rate moves when its membership does, so check its
        share of the cohort before comparing it across years or districts. The race
        axis uses the combined asian_pacific_islander bucket — not comparable
        row-for-row with split-convention topics without aggregating those topics'
        asian + pacific_islander rows at query time. State rows have NULL
        district_code and school_code; district rows have NULL school_code.
      * Series break in 2011: From 2011 Georgia reports the federal four-year
        adjusted-cohort graduation rate, while 2004-2010 use the state's earlier
        leaver-based count, so the state rate falls from 0.808 (2010) to 0.675 (2011)
        and the cohort rises from 113,364 to 131,012 because the method changed, not
        because fewer students graduated.

      -- Geometry dataset: school_attendance_zones -----------------------------------
      School attendance zones for Georgia's public school districts: the polygons
      that assign a home address to its zoned elementary, middle and high school. One
      row per zoned school, level and grade band, for the 2026-27 school year.
      Districts with one zoned school per grade carry the district outline as each
      school's zone. Built from each district's own GIS layers, routing-vendor lookup
      APIs, georeferenced PDF and image maps, and published street lists, and, by
      owner decision where no newer map exists, the NCES School Attendance Boundary
      Survey 2015-16 lines, then clipped to the district's Census TIGER/Line
      boundary. Join school_code (with district_code) to the schools dimension for
      names, NCES ids and coordinates.

      -- Notes -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      * Limitations: Not an official enrollment determination: confirm any assignment
        with the district. A zone is the default assignment, not the only option:
        students can attend another public school by transfer or at charter, magnet
        and other choice schools (see the attendance_rules route). Coverage varies by
        district (see the coverage table); a point inside a district but outside
        every zone of a level is a gap, never filled by guessing a school: usually
        the source assigns it to no school, sometimes a sliver where the source's
        line and the Census district line differ (the coverage table's reason counts
        the residents in both). Digitized maps do have their road and label holes,
        and unaddressed street-list blocks, given to the nearest zone. Some
        districts' choice or transfer areas (such as Social Circle's Zone 5) are not
        zones and are not modelled. Digitized zones carry georeferencing error
        (positional_rmse_m) and approximate reconstructions are coarser still. Some
        lines predate adopted changes (currency_status = stale_known_changes).
        Charter, magnet, alternative, virtual and special-program schools have no
        zones: the school status table (_school_status.parquet, served at
        /school_status) lists every school of the 180 standard districts with whether
        it has a zone here and, if not, why.
      * A zone is the default assignment, not the only option: a Georgia student may
        attend another public school by transfer, or a charter, magnet or other
        choice school. See attendance_rules for the main ways.
      * Not an official enrollment determination: attendance zones change, and these
        are reconstructed from published sources of varying currency and accuracy
        (see each zone's method, accuracy_class and currency_status). Confirm with
        the school district.
